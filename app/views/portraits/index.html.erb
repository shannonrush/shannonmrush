		<p class="info">My portrait sessions are designed to be fun and non-intimidating. My goal as a photographer is for you to have a nice experience and portraits that you love. The portrait packages listed here are for your convenience. If you don't see one that fits your needs <%= mail_to "shannon@shannonmrush.com", "contact me" %> - I'll be happy to put together a custom package for you.</p>
		<p class="info">Portrait sessions can be held at your home, at a special location of your choice (I can also make suggestions - Colorado is full of beautiful outdoor locations!), or in my Boulder studio.</p>  
		<p class="info">Before your photo shoot I will consult with you via phone or email to learn a little bit about you and plan a photo session tailored to suit your needs and preferences.</p>
		<p class="info">After your photo shoot your finished portraits will be available at your own online gallery where you and your loved ones can view your images and order prints.  All of your photo shoots will remain in your gallery with an easy to share link for friends and family.  Your gallery can be password protected at your request.  <%= mail_to "shannon@shannonmrush.com","Contact me"%> to schedule your photography session.</p>
